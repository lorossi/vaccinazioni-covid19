- ~The last chart is not updating correctly while clicking on radio label.~ **FIXED**
- Theres some missing data from before January 7th. Is there even a way to fix this? I don't want to manually go through newspapers for each day.
- ~The number of new vaccinated people and new vaccine doses is wrong.~ **FIXED**
